# Frandre

This project is **entirely work-in-progress** and basically nothing is available yet.

## Early demo

## What?

'Frandre' stands for *F*unctional *R*eactive *An*imation *Dr*awing *E*nvironment.

It is a project inspired by Fran, Functional Reactive Animation, the now defunct but elegant combinator library. It allows users to define animations (or other interactive programs) in a functional reactive programming (FRP) style. (Straightforward name, isn't it?)

Frandre is (to be) a *graphical* environment for creating such programs. The user would draw a *circuit* of reactive components, and Frandre would interpret it.

Now a basic circuit editor and interpreter is ready (see demo above), but it has lots of problems, and there aren't enough components to be useful. But it's already reacting! Isn't it cute?

*Etymology note*: There's a cute (!) vampire in the game series *Touhou Project*. Her name is *Flandre Scarlet* and she's nicknamed *Flan*.

## Usage

Sorry I'll post more details later :smile:
