# Frandre

This project is **entirely** work-in-progress and nothing is available yet.

'Frandre' stands for *F*unctional *R*eactive *An*imation *Dr*awing *E*nvironment.

It is a project inspired by Fran, Functional Reactive Animation, the now defunct but elegant combinator library. It allows users to define animations (or other interactive programs) in a functional reactive programming (FRP) style. (Straightforward name, isn't it?)

Frandre is (to be) a *graphical* environment for creating such programs. The user would draw a *circuit* of reactive components, and Frandre would interpret it.

*Etymology note*: There's a cute (!) vampire in the game series *Touhou Project*. Her name is *Flandre Scarlet* and she's nicknamed *Flan*.
